 * The program should do the following: 
 * 1. Get the name of the cashier and use it in records
 * 2. Commit customer transactions to the account which they control
 * 3. Display records of all transactions run during the instance of 
 * the system being open
 * 
 * Structure:
 * 	Get name of cashier as string
 * 	Initialize the customer counter for the day as integer
 * 	Initialize the array of customer names as strings
 * 	Initialize the array of account numbers as numbers
 * 	1st level while loop to indicate if the cashier is handling a customer
 * 		Get the name of the customer as {array of customer names[customer counter]}
 * 		Get account number of customer as {array of account numbers[customer counter]}
 * 		1st level while loop to analyze transactions
 * 			2nd Conditional to designate what transaction is being done
 * 				1. Deposit
 * 					Add deposit amount to account balance
 * 					Add transaction to the records
 * 				2. Withdrawal
 * 					Subtract withdrawal amount from account balance
 * 					Add transaction to the records
 * 		1st Conditional to designate if the customer is done
 * 			1. Yes
 * 				Terminate loop
 * 			2. No
 * 				Pass loop
