/*
 * The program should do the following: 
 * 1. Get the name of the cashier and use it in records
 * 2. Commit customer transactions to the account which they control
 * 3. Display records of all transactions run during the instance of 
 * the system being open
 * 
 * Structure:
 * 	Get name of cashier as string
 *  Initialize current cashier action as {an integer equal to 0}
 * 	Initialize customer counter for the day as {an integer equal to 0}
 * 	Initialize array of customer names as strings
 * 	Initialize array of account numbers as integers
 * 	Initialize array of account balances as floating point numbers (floats)
 * 	1st level while loop to measure what the cashier is doing
 * 		2nd level conditional for analyzing cashier actions
 * 			0. Handling customers
 * 				Get the name of the customer as {customer names[customer counter]}
 * 				Get account number of customer as {account numbers[customer counter]}
 * 				3rd level while loop to analyze transactions
 * 					4th level Conditional to designate what transaction is being done
 * 						0. Deposit
 * 							Add deposit amount to account balance
 * 							Add transaction to the records
 * 						1. Withdrawal
 * 							Subtract withdrawal amount from account balance
 * 							Add transaction to the records
 * 				3rd Conditional to designate if the customer is done
 * 					0. Yes
 * 						Set customer counter to next value {+1}
 * 						Terminate loop
 * 					1. No
 * 						Pass loop
 * 			1. Checking records
 * 				For every customer in range 0 --> current customer (last value - 1)
 * 					Print(customer names[customer], "with account number", account numbers[customer])
 * 					Print("has a balance of", account balances[customer])
 * 	1st level conditional to check what the cashier is doing next
 * 		0. Customer handling
 * 			Set current cashier action as 0
 * 			Pass loop 
 * 		1. Checking records
 * 			Set current cashier action as 1
 * 			Pass loop
 * 		2. Done for the day
 * 			Print goodbye message
 * 			Terminate loop
